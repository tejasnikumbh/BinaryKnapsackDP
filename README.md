Tutorial Style Implementation of Solution to the Binary Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming

*******************************************READ ME file for the project **********************************************
This file contains compiling instructions for the VLSI CAD Project.

The src folder contains two subfolders, which are named scilab and cplusplus

 - Inside the scilab folder, the file dynamicKnapsack is present.

  The dynamicKnapsack file here is the scilab implementation/demo of the dynamic 
algorithm for the knapsack problem.

 - Inside the cplusplus folder, the file dynamicKnapsack.cpp is present.

  The dynamicKnapsack file here is the c++ implementation/demo of the dynamic 
algorithm for the knapsack problem.

   Compiling instructions for the c++ file : 
     You can compile the c++ file by.
     1. Going (using cd) to the folder in which this file is present, and
     2. Compiling it by using 
          g++ dynamicKnapsack.cpp -o dynamicKnapsack.out
     3. Run this file by typing 
          ./dynamicKnapsack.out in the terminal/shell, while being in the same directory as that of the object file.

   For ease, a ready made compiled file dynamicKnapsack.out has been provided, which can directly be run by typing
     ./dynamicKnapsack.out
